# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

We are representing being hired as a Data Analyst by PyBer, a python based ride-sharing app company. The first task for PyBer is to perform an exploratory anylysis on large csv files and report a compelling story about the data. This will be achived by writing python scripts using Pandas libraries, Jupyter Notebook and Matplotib to create charts showcasing the relationship between the type of city, the number of driver and riders, as well as the percetage of total fares, drivers and riders by type of city. The analysis we provide will help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

As for the second assigment together with our manager Omar, we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results:

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

## Summary: 

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Finally, youâ€™ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
