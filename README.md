# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

We are representing being hired as a Data Analyst by PyBer, a python based ride-sharing app company. The first assignment we have for PyBer is to perform an exploratory analysis on large csv files and then report a compelling story about the data. This will be achived by writing Python scripts using Pandas, Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib. We will create charts showcasing the relationship between the type of city, the number of drivers and rides, as well as the percetage of total fares, drivers and riders by type of city. 

As for the second assigment together with our manager Omar, we created a  [summary DataFrame](#Summary-DataFrame) of the ride-sharing data by city type and created a [multiple-line graph](#Pyber-Chart) that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results:   

### Analysis performed in [PyBer DataFrame](https://github.com/Lesliec87/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)

### Summary DataFrame:

### PyBer Chart

Differences found in ride-sharing data among the different city types:
- The highest in total rides, drivers and fares is "Urban", followed by "Suburban" and the least is "Rural."
- The highest in average fare per ride and fare per driver is "Rural, followed by "Suburban and then "Urban."
- For each week the fare amounts seem to stay consistent through out the city types.


## Summary: 

This analysis will help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. After reviewing the city types it seems that the availability of ride sharing services are much higher in the urban and suburban areas and making it more affordable. 

However, for the rural areas because there is not as much availabitly of PyBer's ride sharing services the fares are much higher and less affordable so this causes less demand for the services in this area. This can definitley be an area of opportunity to increase availability and making the fares a more consistent price compared to the other areas.
